# ActivityTracker
People tend to browse the web for numerous hours and during these hours sometimes they fail to be productive. In this era of social media where short videos have taken over the world, time seems to flow without much realization. 

This project is a chrome extension that will track all the time you are spending on each website. The aim of this project will be to make people focus on productivity and reduce the time spent on distractive websites like Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, etc.
